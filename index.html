     <h1>Projects</h1>
       <P>EMPOWERING INDUSTRY 4.0: THE SYNERGY OF ARDUINO IDE AND MS EXCEL FOR ADVANCED 
        MANUFACTURING AUTOMATION: Our groundbreaking solution seamlessly merges Arduino IDE, MS Excel, 
        and OpenCV, transforming control and data management in manufacturing. This integration ensures unmatched 
        automation accuracy, real-time error detection, and streamlined packaging processes. Leveraging OpenCV's camera 
        capabilities enables advanced visual monitoring, refining precision and efficiency. With optimized resource usage 
        and reduced human intervention, this integration represents a pivotal advancement in manufacturing efficiency.  </P>
 <p>ADVANCED POULTRY MANAGEMENT: TECH-INTEGRATED GAS CONTROL FOR HEALTHIER  
 LIVESTOCK: Developing an automatic sensor model to monitor ammonia/H2S emissions in poultry litter, our solution  integrates cutting-edge technology. Ammonia Gas Sensor alerts for levels above 25 ppm, while Steamer Technology neutralizes  ammonia. Compact Exhaust Fans manage odors, and Microcontroller Integration ensures seamless operations. Filtration, Fly 
Deterrence, and Temperature Sensors further optimize efficiency. Ideal for modern poultry farming. </p>
 <p>AUTOMATED STAIN DETECTION:Our machine learning-based system, utilizing OpenCV and Tkinter, detects dirt on 
clothes, enhancing textile industry quality control. It alerts workers to impurities, boosting efficiency, product quality, and 
brand reputation, driving productivity and upholding high standards in textile manufacturing through innovative technology 
integration. </p>
<p>REAL-TIME EARTH LEAKAGE DETECTION: Developed a Real-time Earth Leakage Detection and Alert System for 
    parking lights, electric poles, and critical zones using CT sensors to monitor earth leakage and earthing health continuously. 
    Implemented LoRa-based communication for long-range, low-power data transmission, enabling high efficiency. Designed a 
    system to provide instant alerts with precise location mapping via an app and dashboard, incorporating unique sensor IDs and 
    timestamps for authentication. Utilized an Arduino-based setup for operation in remote regions with limited infrastructure, 
    ensuring offline capability and feasibility by requiring internet access only for the LoRa WAN gateway</p>
